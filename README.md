## Tow Dots Game

This is a simple game called "Tow Dots" implemented using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

### Game Description

The game involves dots of different colors that appear on the screen. The objective is to connect dots of the same color by drawing lines between them. When a line connects two dots of the same color, both the line and the dots disappear, and the player earns a point. The game continues as new dots appear on the screen, and the player tries to connect them to earn more points.

### How to Play

- When the game starts, you will see a "Play" button in the center of the screen. Click or touch the button to start the game.
- Dots of different colors will start appearing on the screen.
- Click or touch and drag the mouse to draw lines between dots of the same color.
- When a line connects two dots of the same color, they will disappear, and you will earn a point.
- Keep connecting dots to earn more points.


### Files

The game consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the game page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling for the game elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic.

### Dependencies

The game has the following dependencies:

- The "Press Start 2P" font from Google Fonts, which is imported in the CSS file.
- An audio file named "Easy song.mp3", which is played as background music. Make sure to provide the audio file in the same directory as the game files.
- An image file named "play1.png", which is used for the "Play" button. Make sure to provide the image file in the same directory as the game files.

### Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Place all the game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) in the same directory.
2. Make sure to provide the required dependencies mentioned above (font, audio file, and image file) in the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Click or touch the "Play" button to start the game.
5. Connect dots of the same color by drawing lines between them to earn points.

### Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the code in the `script.js` file. Here are some possible modifications you can make:

- Adjust the canvas size by changing the values of `CANVAS_WIDTH` and `CANVAS_HEIGHT` variables.
- Modify the appearance of the dots, lines, and other game elements by modifying the relevant drawing and styling code in the JavaScript and CSS files.
- Customize the game rules, scoring system, or add new features by modifying the game logic implemented in the `script.js` file.

Note: If you make any modifications, make sure to test the game thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
